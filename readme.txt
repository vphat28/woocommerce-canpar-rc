This plugin will return the shipping cost of an order.

== Description ==
The Canpar Rate Calculator plugin uses Canpar`s Web Services API to return a rate calculation for a shipment.

== Installation ==
1) Unzip the plugin directory.
2) Upload the extracted woocommerce-canpar-rc directory into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3) Activate the plugin via the `Plugins` menu option in the Wordpress admin panel.
4) Complete the configuration of the plugin in the WooCommerce settings, under the `Shipping` tab, and then the `Canpar Rate Calculator` sub menu option.
5) Make sure that the `Weight Unit` and `Dimensions Unit` under the WooCommerce `Products` tab in the Settings is set to kg/lb and cm/in. These are the only two weight units the calculator recognizes.
6) Populate the weight of each product. The dimensions are optional, but recommended for rate accuracy.

Reference the accompanying `Settings and Troubleshooting` document for further detailed installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and development information.
